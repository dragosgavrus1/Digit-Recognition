# Digit-Recognition
A digit recognition ML project using tensorflow neural networks and computer vision to check handwritten digits making a prediction on the most likely digit.
OpenCV aids in preprocessing digit images, ensuring consistency and enhancing feature extraction.With a focus on training and evaluation, the model's performance is monitored using metrics like accuracy and loss. 
Real-time digit recognition capabilities empower users to input handwritten digits for instant classification
